                              Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are implantable medical devices designed to prevent blood clots from moving through bloodstreams and into lungs.  These devices are implanted into the human body and experience a significant amount of mechanical loading due to compression of the vessel on the device with every heartbeat.  Therefore, durability testing for these and similar devices is crucial for ensuring device performance and safety over the lifetime of the device, which is many years and decades.  Tests such as these are important to understand materials and device failure limits and to validate mechanical durability of final device designs.  Both are useful for regulatory submittals and approvals by FDA and similar regulatory bodies. 
                              <br><br>
                              In this test example, a modified hook vena cava filter was placed inside a length of silicone tubing, simulating the filter inside a vein. This was placed in an ElectroForce 3200 test instrument which was used to physically apply the loading to the tube and device.  An ElectroForce 5500, DMA 3200 or 3300 would yield similar results.  The 10Hz loading profile was a cyclic compression sequence of 300 cycles of 5% compression to the filter followed by 50 cycles of 20% compression.  That loading combination was repeated over 1 million times with the goal of testing for 10 years of heartbeats, or 400 Million cycles.   
                              <br><br>
                              Even when accelerated at 10Hz, this test will last 15 months.  Therefore, these tests are often accelerated even more to reduce testing times to 3-6 months.  The high-speed performance and reliability of the ElectroForce test instruments is a perfect match for high cycle tests like these.

                                   <b>Methods:</b> Two ODTs were tested on an ElectroForce® 3100 test instrument to measure their disintegration response.  Two brands with different dissolve/disintegration technology, ranging from 20 seconds to 220 seconds of dissolve time, were tested. Force and displacement data as a function of time was recorded for each ODT. 

                                        <br><br>

                                   The test was performed by placing a single ODT between compression platens (plates) in an ElectroForce 3100 test instrument. This test can also be performed on ElectroForce models 5500 and 3200 and give similar results.  
                                   <br><br>
                                    
                                   
                                   An upper platen is driven and controlled using a dynamic linear motor capable of force or displacement control.  In this case, it was used was to apply a preload force of 10 mN to the ODT.  Then approximately 5 mL of 37ºC water was placed around the ODT to simulate disintegration of the tablet in the mouth.  As the water reacted with the tablet and the tablet disintegrated, the linear motor maintained a force of approximately 10 mN on the remainder of the tablet. Once the tablet was mostly or wholly dissolved, the test was manually stopped. Based on these results, a clear difference in slope can be used to show a difference in dissolution times of OTDs.

                                         Implantable medical devices such as breast implants must be thoroughly evaluated for performance and reliability in many aspects.  TA Instruments’ 3300 and 3510 load frames can be used to characterize the mechanical strength and durability of such devices.  These insights are crucial for both the design optimization and final validation that is required for regulation. 
                                              <br><br>
                                         One such test is the monotonic compression testing to failure as described in ISO 14607.  An example of the results from this test are shown in the first figure where static rupture of the implant can be seen in the abrupt truncation of the curve. The maximum force before rupture was approximately 6,000 N of compression. 
                                         
                                          <br><br>
                                         Cyclic compression testing is a fatigue test method that is aimed at characterizing the durability of implants.  As illustrated by the second figure, cyclic loading in force control from 22.5 N to –225 N at a frequency of 3.33 Hz is run until the device fails (as in the first figure), or until a satisfactory number of cycles (run-out) is obtained.

                                               Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel sheets (4” x 4”) were purchased from Medline Industries. These samples were testing in compression in an ElectroForce® 5500 test instrument equipped with a 200 N force sensor and a pair of 25 mm diameter compression platens.  
                                                    <br><br>
                                               The hydrogel was characterized for performance using a measured walking gait strain profile (Halonen et al., 2013).  This is shown as the red trace in the first figure.  This trace was digitized and used as the targeted strain for the test simulation.  It was scaled in time to simulate a 5 km/hr walking speed and used as the drive signal for the ElectroForce motor.  The resulting strain applied to the test sample is shown in the second figure, with the corresponding measured force response of the sample.

                                               Three specimens were tested individually with the external waveform, and displacement and load data were tracked during the test. The same external waveform was successfully applied to each specimen. Similar testing results of three specimen were achieved and reliable repeatability of this testing method was demonstrated (controlled displacement difference between samples: < 2.5%; force response difference between samples: < 13.9%).

                                                     Viscoelastic materials exhibit a creep response when they are held at a constant force. Creep testing was performed on porcine trachea by compressing ring sections of trachea in the axial and longitudinal configurations. The samples were compressed to 120 g of force and held for four minutes while the strain was measured (see figure). A nonlinear creep response was observed in both compression configurations, consistent with viscoelastic material behavior. Compressed samples appeared to have less longitudinal creep stain than axial creep strains.  
                                                          <br><br>
                                                     Viscoelastic materials also exhibit stress-relaxation, in which a nonlinear stress response is observed when a constant strain is applied. Stress relaxation tests were performed with the sample under tension and compression. Samples were either pulled in tension or compressed to 25% strain and held for four minutes while the stress response relaxed. Results (see figure) indicate that the tensile relaxation is less than the compressive relaxation of the tracheal ring. 
                                                     <br><br>
                                                     The hysteresis response was investigated by cyclically preconditioning a ring sample, followed immediately by loading and unloading. The ring was placed between two platens in the axial position, and 25 g of force was applied at a frequency of 1.0 Hz for 10 cycles. The sample was then compressed with 50 g of force (corresponding to 30% compressive strain), and the load was subsequently removed. A lag between the loading and unloading portions of the curve can be seen in the hysteresis plot. The area between these portions of the curve signifies the energy that is dissipated as a result of the material’s viscoelastic nature.

                                                           Human Cortical Bone was characterized in 4-point bending to evaluate differences between samples from old and young people.

                                                           A custom designed 4-point bend fixture was attached to the ElectroForce® 3200 instrument. The bend fixture, which has adjustable upper and lower spans, was set so that the upper span was 0.70 mm and the lower span was 2.68 mm. The support points of the top and bottom fixtures are rounded blade edges, thereby minimizing the damage to and contact with the specimen.

                                                           The Electroforce test systems utilize a proprietary electromagnetic linear actuator design, which provides exceptional force and displacement control.  For these tests, the instruments force sensor [50 lbf (225 N)] and displacement transducer [+/- 6.5 mm] were used. A customer-provided high-resolution digital camera was used to take photographs of the specimens to independently confirm strain measurements.

                                                           The WinTest® control software’s block waveform function was used to implement the test protocol. An initial monotonic displacement-controlled test to 0.5% strain (based upon each specimen’s geometry) was applied to each specimen to determine the elastic bending modulus. The multicyclic testing was subsequently performed in force control and the force, displacement, and geometric parameters of each specimen were used to calculate the stresses and strains desired. The waveform itself consisted of a ramp to a load level, holding that load for 60 seconds, ramping to a nearly unloaded state at -0.1 N, again holding for 60 seconds, and then ramping to a load larger than the previous value. This process was repeated until all loading levels were completed. The stress values were 35, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 MPa.

                                                            The bending modulus, which was calculated from the initial bending test, was found to range from 3.7 to 14.7 GPa. Based upon the agreement of these values with those found in existing literature for similar specimen sizes and loading configurations, it was determined that micromechanical testing can now be used to determine the mechanical properties of smaller bone specimens. In addition, the study also revealed age-related differences in the material properties of bone. Significant differences were observed in the creep rate and creep strain between younger and older donor bone. It was hypothesized that these results demonstrate a degradation of the collagen network in bone as creep is exhibited by polymers, and the primary polymer in bone is collagen.

                                                                 Researchers at the University of Minnesota, under the guidance of Dr. Jack Lewis, have been reviewing the issues of characterizing the mechanical properties of articular cartilage. In order to quantify the properties, cartilage must be tested in a unique dynamic loading system capable of providing precision creep capabilities while also providing a dynamic loading component during the same cycle. The ElectroForce® 3200 test instrument provides the capabilities required in a compact tabletop package.  Similar results could be obtained with other ElectroForce instruments such as models 3100, 5500 and 3300.

                                                                 Cartilage tissue in vivo is under a constant compressive load with superimposed dynamic loads.  Therefore, specimen preparation and preloading are important aspects of in vitro test methods because articular cartilage has both a short time viscoelastic behavior and a long time constant for fluid retention.

                                                                 The plots show both cartilage response in both creep and relaxation tests and different loading rates, effectively modeling the material properties and characterizing the tissues under various conditions.
