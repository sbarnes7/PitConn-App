                        TAM IV is the most sensitive, stable and flexible microcalorimeter system in the world for directly measuring this universal heat signal and, therefore, the quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic observation of any process. It is a unique microcalorimeter system that is completely modular and combines the highest heat flow sensitivity with unmatched long term temperature stability for measuring many processes that are undetectable by other techniques. A wide range of calorimeter configurations and sample handling systems provide maximum application flexibility and ensure optimum laboratory productivity.

                    <h3><b>Calorimeters</b></h3>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Nanocalorimeter</h5>
                    The Nanocalorimeter is the most sensitive calorimeter for the TAM IV, and is typically used in the isothermal mode. It combines high sensitivity with excellent baseline stability which makes it ideal for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in studying molecular interactions. The nanocalorimeter holds all closed ampoules up to 4 ml. For highest sensitivity it is used with the 1 ml titration ampoule and a similar ampoule as reference. This reference ampoule contains an inert substance, (e.g. water or sand) in order to balance the heat capacity of the two sides. Thus, under normal conditions the heat flow associated with the reference ampoule will be negligible. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Microcalorimeter</h5>
The 20 ml Microcalorimeter is a heat flow calorimeter of twin type. It has been designed to hold large samples, (e.g. batteries) and for experiments requiring a large gas phase above the sample. The microcalorimeter can be used with all 20 ml static ampoules and the 20 ml micro reaction system including titration facilities and control of the relative humidity during measurement. 
                    <br>
The 20ml Microcalorimeter is also the only calorimeter that can be used with the micro solution ampoule. This ampoule is designed for dissolution of very small amounts of solids (a few mg) in different solvents and is ideal for dissolution of slowly soluble substances. The heat of dissolution and the kinetics of dissolution can be studied. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Minicalorimeter</h5>
                    The Minicalorimeter is a 4 mL or 20mL calorimeter with a special design to reduce the space occupied by the calorimeter inside the thermostat. The reference is positioned below the sample ampoule which up to 48 4 mL Minicalorimeters can be positioned in the TAM IV-48 thermostat. The Minicalorimeter is also used in the Multicalorimeter where six 4 mL minicalorimeters and three 20 mL calorimeters are assembled together and each assembly occupies one position in the TAM IV thermostat. It has been designed for increased sample throughput.

 <h3><b>Ampoules</b></h3>
                    <br>
                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Closed Ampoules</h5>
                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Disposable Crimp Seal Glass Ampoules</h5>
                    Disposable ampoules are the most convenient to use since they can be thrown away after use and no cleaning is required. The crimp seal ampoule is perfect for experiments at lower temperature ranges. They are available in 3, 4 and 20 ml sizes. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Stainless Steel Ampoules</h5>
                    Available in regular stainless steel or hastelloy, these ampoules are used for samples that either react with glass, are to be investigated at high temperatures, or where it is suspected that a gas will be evolved during the experiment which increases the pressure in the ampoule. Ampoule lids are screw top and are available in 4 and 20 ml sizes. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Heat Sealed Ampoules</h5>
                    The heat seal ampoules are sealed by melting the glass at the top of the ampoule. These are recommended when rubber caps would be affected by gases or liquid involved in a reaction. The reactants are completely surrounded by glass. They are available for a maximum sample volume of 5 ml. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Titration Ampoule</h5>
                    The removable ampoules offer a level of practicality unmatched in the industry. TAM-ITC ampoules are easily removed, can be visually inspected and cleaned outside of the instrument. The open vessels of TAM-ITC ampoules also allows solid suspensions, solid matrixes with attached living cells, macromolecules, etc. to be loaded into the reaction vessel. This allows ligand binding to the solid system to be measured. There is no possibility for this kind of matrix experiments to be run on fixed-cell instruments. 
                    <br>
In TAM-ITC different sizes of syringes ranging from 100 to 2.5 mL are available. The injection volume/flow is controlled by a high precision syringe pump. Each pump can support two syringes. In addition, two pumps can be attached to one titration ampoule which is useful for studying enzyme kinetics. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Perfusion Ampoule</h5>
                    The perfusion ampoule is the simplest micro reaction system available, and is typically used with the Nanocalorimeter. A liquid or gas is perfused through the ampoule and out through an exit tube. Gases are perfused using a mass flow controller that is controlled by TAM Assistant™s software. Liquids are perfused using a peristaltic pump. The perfusion ampoule can be used to measure either the heat production rate from a flowing gas/liquid or the effect of the gas/liquid on a sample placed in the perfusion ampoule. The perfusion ampoule is available in 1, 4 and 20 ml versions. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">RH Perfusion Ampoule</h5>
                    The RH perfusion ampoule perfuses a gas of defined relative humidity over a sample and out through an exit tube. The relative humidity is controlled using two mass flow controllers, one of which passes gas directly to the sample and the other passes gas through two humidifying chambers prior to the sample. TAM Assistant™ software controls both the relative humidity and the total flow rate over the sample. The software is also used to change the humidity in a linear ramp or stepwise. The RH perfusion ampoule is available in 1, 4 and 20 ml versions. It is possible to use solvents other than water in the humidifying chambers which allows a gas of varying vapor pressure of a solvent to be passed over a sample. 

                    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum/Pressure Ampoule</h5>
These stainless steel ampoules are designed to hold vacuum or pressure up to 10 bar. The pressure in the ampoule can be monitored at the same time heat flow is measured. This is ideal for the study of samples generating gaseous products during a reaction. The ampoule is available in 4 and 20 ml sizes.
