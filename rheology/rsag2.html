                    <p>The new RSA-G2 is the most advanced platform for mechanical analysis of solids.
                         The separate motor and transducer technology of the RSA-G2 insures the purest mechanical data through independent control of deformation
                          and measurement of stress. It is capable of performing the most accurate DMA measurements as well as many additional experiments including
                           creep and recovery, stress relaxation, stress ramps, strain rate ramps, iso-strain, iso-force, fatigue, multi-wave, arbitrary waveform,
                            and dielectric thermal analysis. With such a broad range of solid analysis techniques, the RSA-G2 is uniquely positioned to address the
                             widest range of applications from the R&D bench to the quality control lab. This new high-performance instrument represents the fourth 
                             generation of dual head mechanical analyzers, featuring a new force convection oven for precise and accurate temperature control, 
                             extensive array of geometries to accommodate the widest range of sample shapes and stiffness, and immersion testing capability. In 
                             addition, the RSA-G2 doubles as a DETA, or Dielectric Thermal Analyzer, for stand-alone or simultaneous measurements.   </p>

                <b>The RSA-G2 Provides Independent Measurements of Stress and Strain</b><br>
                When it comes to making the most accurate mechanical measurements, two heads are better than one! The mechanical behavior of solid polymers and other materials is described by material functions such as the modulus or compliance. The modulus is the ratio of stress to strain and the compliance is the ratio of strain to stress. In order to make the purest and most accurate viscoelastic measurements, it is best to measure the fundamental parameters of stress and strain independently. This approach, taken by the TA Instruments RSA-G2, leads to measurements free of instrument artifacts over wide ranges of stress, strain, and frequency

                <b>RSA-G2 Design Advantage </b><br>
                At the heart of the RSA-G2 dual-head solids analyzer is the high performance drive motor and unique transducer. The sample is deformed from the bottom by a direct-drive DC-Servo motor featuring all new electronic DSP control.The force generated in the sample is measured at the top by the patented Force Rebalance Transducer(FRT). The RSA-G2 FRT incorporates a highly sensitive position sensor and linear motor with temperature-compensated rare-earth magnets to ensure the most accurate force measurements. The FRT directly measures sample force from the current required to drive the linear motor in the transducer to maintain zero position. Both the drive motor and transducer incorporate precision air bearings for stiff and frictionless support of linear motion and enhanced force sensitivity. The independent force measurement eliminates motor friction and inertia corrections and translates to the purest force measurement available. The RSA-G2 transducer is mounted to the instrument frame by a linear slide and stepper motor allowing for independent vertical positioning. Transducer motion is via a precision ground lead screw attached to a micro-stepping motor by a rigid preloaded duplex bearing eliminating backlash. A linear optical encoder is mounted directly between the stationary frame and moving bracket for precision head positioning to an accuracy of 0.1 micron. The benefits of the independent transducer positioning are:

                        Ease of clamp installation and sample loading

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additional testing capabilities to large deformations such as strain rate tests to pull samples until failure

               </li>
               <li>
                <b>Temperature Control</b><br>
                Temperature and environment control for the RSA-G2 is provided by the new Forced Convection Oven, FCO. The FCO is an air/N2 gas convection oven designed for optimum temperature stability, extremely rapid heating and cooling, and ease of use over the temperature range of -150 to 600 °C. The maximum controlled heating rate is 60 °C/min. Obtaining the -150 °C minimum temperature requires an optional liquid nitrogen-cooling device. Alternatively, an optional mechanical cooling is possible down to a minimum temperature of -80 °C. Superior temperature stability is achieved through the use of twin element heaters, which provide counter-rotating airflow in the oven chamber. The FCO can be mounted on either side of the test station, and comes standard with long-life internal LED lamp and window viewing port.

               <li>
                <b>High-Speed Electronics and Data Processing</b><br>
                The RSA-G2 is equipped with new high-speed electronics with digital signal processing for transducer measurements and motor control.While many manufacturers cut costs by combining the test station and electronics into a single box, the separate electronics approach of TA Instruments RSA-G2 isolates the precision measurements from heat and vibration. This approach ensures the best sensitivity and data quality from the test station. The electronics enable fully integrated high-speed data acquisition for transient (up to 8000Hz) and oscillation (up to 15000Hz) measurements. The high sampling speed provides superior resolution of magnitude and phase of the measured signals, and allows much better higher harmonic resolution for automatic analysis during oscillation tests or post Fourier transformation analysis. Higher odd harmonics that occur in the stress (force) signal in oscillation tests are a result of non-linear response. The ratio of the fundamental frequency to odd harmonics, such as 3rd, 5th, etc. can be calculated and stored as a signal. In addition, the real-time waveforms during oscillation tests can be displayed and saved with data points. The intensity ratio and quality and shape of the waveform are invaluable data integrity and validation tools.

                <b>Touch Screen and Keypad</b><br>
                This graphical interface adds a new dimension in ease-of-use. Interactive activities such as clamp zeroing, sample loading, and setting temperature can be performed at the test station. Important instrument status and test information such as temperature, gap, force and motor position are displayed. The touch-screen also provides easy access to instrument settings and diagnostic reporting. The keypad at the base of the instrument allows for easy positioning of the measurement head.

                <b>FCO Camera Viewer</b><br>
                The FCO can be fitted with an optional camera viewer accessory. The camera includes additional lighting and focus controls which can be adjusted through the TRIOS control software. During the experiment real-time images are displayed in the software and images can be stored with data points for subsequent viewing.

                                The figure to the right shows the storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan d for temperature ramp tests run on an automotive coating tested in air and immersed in a solvent. The solvent has a dramatic effect on the mechanical properties of the coating. The water has a plasticizing effect on the material. The glass transition temperature is observed to decrease by almost 29 °C from 102 °C to 73 °C. The figure on the right shows a series of frequency sweeps run on an Elastomer sample immersed in synthetic oil at a temperature of 25 °C for three days. The frequency sweep was run on the sample as soon as immersed on day one, and repeated on days two and three. The storage modulus E’ showed a 16% decrease in magnitude over the three days.

                                The figure to the right shows results of a temperature sweep on a pressure sensitive adhesive over a temperature range of 40 °C to 80 °C. At each 10 °C step in the sweep, the sample was scanned over a frequency range of 0.1 to 100 Hz. The storage modulus is plotted as a function of frequency for each 10 °C step. This is the method of choice for Time Temperature Superposition studies as all the frequency-dependent data are collected at the same temperature.
